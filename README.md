Volume Cartographer
===================
A library and toolkit for the virtual unwrapping of volumetric datasets.


### Dependencies  
**Required**  
* C++14 compiler (gcc 4.9+, clang 3.4+ or VS 2015+)
* CMake 3.5+
* OpenCV 3+
* Insight Toolkit (itk) 4.10+
* Visualization Toolkit (vtk) 7 or 8
    * [ACVD Mesh Simplification](https://github.com/valette/ACVD) add-on library
* Boost 1.58+
* Qt 5.7+
* [libtiff](https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff) 4.0+
* Eigen3 3.2+
* spdlog

**Optional**  
* [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) - For documentation
* [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) - For Python binding support
* [VCG library](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/vcglib) - For VCG's Quadric Edge Collapse Decimation

### Compilation  
The VC suite uses CMake to simplify builds. 
This suite is primarily developed and tested on macOS and Debian. 
It _should_ work on other Unix/Linux systems, but this is currently untested. 
If you have already installed the dependencies listed above, compilation should be as simple as:  
```shell
git clone https://code.cs.uky.edu/seales-research/volume-cartographer.git
cd volume-cartographer
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Many `volume-cartographer` libraries can be built in parallel, and compilation times will be improved by running `make -j4`.
Alternatively, you can use CMake to generate [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) build system files:  
```shell
cmake -GNinja ..
ninja
```


##### (Optional) Use vc-deps dependencies
To assist with installing dependencies, we have created the [vc-deps project](https://code.cs.uky.edu/seales-research/vc-deps).
While this project can be used on its own to install the dependencies to the system, we also provide it as a git submodule within `volume-cartographer`.
Note that `vc-deps` **does not** install CMake or Qt.  

To build and link against in-source `vc-deps` libraries, run the following:  
```shell
# Get the source code plus all submodules
git clone --recursive https://code.cs.uky.edu/seales-research/volume-cartographer.git

# Build vc-deps
cd volume-cartographer/vc-deps
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Return to the volume-cartographer directory
cd ../..

# Build volume-cartographer
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DVC_PREBUILT_LIBS=ON ..
make
```

### Installation
To install the compiled software and libraries to the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, run the `install` target:
```shell
make install
```

### Packaging

To generate an installer package, run the `package` target:
```shell
make package
```

##### (Optional) Build a deployable macOS installer
To build a deployable macOS installer DMG for macOS 10.9+, use the `vc-deps` submodule to build the dependencies as universal libraries:
```shell
# Get the source code plus all submodules
git clone --recursive https://code.cs.uky.edu/seales-research/volume-cartographer.git

# Build vc-deps
cd volume-cartographer/vc-deps
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_UNIVERSAL_LIBS=ON ..
make
cd ../../

# Build volume-cartographer
mkdir build
cd build
export OSX_SDK_VERSION="10.9"
export OSX_SDK_PATH="../vc-deps/build/osx-sdk-prefix/src/osx-sdk/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/"
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DVC_PREBUILT_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=$OSX_SDK_VERSION -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=$OSX_SDK_PATH ..
make && make package
```

### Testing
Tests are built by default and use the Boost.Test framework.
Test can be run using CTest or by running the `test` target:
```shell
make test
```

To disable tests, set the `VC_BUILD_TESTS` flag to off:
```shell
cmake -DVC_BUILD_TESTS=OFF ..
```

### Documentation
Library documentation is built using Doxygen and can be enabled/disabled by setting the `VC_BUILD_DOC` flag.
Documentation will be installed with the `install` target if the `VC_INSTALL_DOC` flag is enabled.
```shell
cmake -DVC_BUILD_DOC=ON -DVC_INSTALL_DOC=ON ..
```

### Python Bindings (WIP)
We currently maintain limited Python binding support through pybind11. 
They are a work-in-progress and should not be used in production code.  

Bindings can be built and installed by setting the `VC_BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS` and `VC_INSTALL_PYTHON_BINDINGS` flags:
```shell
cmake -DVC_BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -DVC_INSTALL_PYTHON_BINDINGS=ON ..
```

To use these bindings in Python after installation, import from the `volcart` package:
```python
import volcart.Core as c
import numpy as np

vpkg = c.VolumePkg('/path/to/package.volpkg')
vol = vpkg.volume()
r = vol.reslice(np.array([0,0,0]))
```

__NOTE:__ Python modules are built as shared libraries, regardless of the `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`
flag set by this project. This can cause problems if the Volume Cartographer dependencies
are not built as shared libraries. Either install the shared versions of these 
libraries (preferred) or compile static libraries with position independent code (PIC).

If using `vc-deps` to build the dependency libraries, set the appropriate CMake flags:
```shell
# Build shared libraries (preferred)
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..

# Build static libraries with PIC
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON ..
```
